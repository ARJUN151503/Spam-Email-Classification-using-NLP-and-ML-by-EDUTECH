# Spam Email Classification using NLP and ML by EDUTECH
## Description

This appears to be a Python script for analyzing a spam SMS dataset, and it should contains spam basic coding like data preprocessing and other progress is done as involving several key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded spam SMS dataset from "spam.csv"
- Dropped unnecessary columns
- Removed duplicate entries
- Checked for null values

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Created a donut chart showing class distribution of spam/ham messages
- Used word frequency analysis to identify most common words

3. Text Processing Techniques:
- Removed URLs, mentions, hashtags
- Eliminated stopwords using NLTK
- Used Counter to track word frequencies

4. Visualization:
- Pie/donut chart for class distribution
- Horizontal bar chart for top 10 most frequent words

Key Libraries Used:
- pandas for data manipulation
- nltk for text processing
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
- re for regular expressions
- Counter for word frequency counting

The analysis reveals insights into message characteristics, helping distinguish between spam and legitimate (ham) messages through word usage patterns and code is continues for NLP with other techniques is on going.
